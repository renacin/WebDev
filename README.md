## 1.0 Introduction ##
Websites are just cool. You can use them to share pictures, ideas; or even use them to host games, and music. These are just a few things that can be accomplished with websites.
Usability and accessibility aside, websites can be fairly difficult to create. With anything based in code and/or markup, a significant learning curve is almost always present; websites are no different.

In the past I have tried to follow tutorials, courses, and other structured workflows to understand the basics of Web Development; but none have stuck. After a few weeks of forced effort I most always regressed
to programming in Python (a language that I am fairly confident in) or to some other personal project. But weeks later, I'm yet again amazed by snazzy websites, or another incredibly polished React apps; and the burning
desire to learn to develop websites always comes back.

I guess this is my third or fourth time trying to learn Web Development (I've honestly lost track). But unlike my previous attempts I won't follow a structured approach. Instead I'll learn to develop websites like I did with Python;
build projects that I'm interested in and learn as I'm going.

As follows is the first couple of steps in my never-ending journey into Web Development.

## 1.1 Overview of Projects Completed ##
Here are a few of the projects that I have completed in my journey to become a Web Developer.

### 2.1 Basic Personal Website ###
I want to build a personal. Nothing fancy, no moving carousels, call to subscriptions, or CSS animations (okay maybe one or two). I just want a place to archive my thoughts and personal projects and that's it.
