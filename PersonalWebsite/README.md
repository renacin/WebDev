## 1.0 General Overview of Project ##
I want to build a blog. Nothing fancy, no moving carousels, call to subscriptions, or CSS animations (okay maybe one or two). I just want a blog to achieve my thoughts and personal projects and that's it.

<br/>

## 1.1 Design Approach ##
As previously mentioned, the blog that I want to create should be simple - free of anything that may slow the learning process. However it should look like a blog that I created. It should have my style.
I've put together a series of screenshots as well as general themes that I want to emulate in my blog that will help describe the look that I'm after.

I know, an artboards doesn't really explain much - let alone convey the idea that I have going in my head; but I can get the general picture across. I want a straight forward blog that has a simple yet modern layout. Making
conservative use of simple polygons (mostly rectangles), high contrast fonts, as well as colors - most of the website should be dedicated to negative space. I want the reader to quickly understand the flow of the blog, find
what they need and accomplish what they came to do. Simple enough.

In terms of styling I want the blog to look like an IDE, or some sort of programming environment. Unlike programming however, I still want the website to friendly and approachable. Most people are quite afraid of the command
line; I don't want that.

I've roughed out the main page in Illustrator. Here is what I started with.

After a couple more edits here is what I have so far. Simple, and clean.

## 1.2 Review Of Development ##
Having been my third or so attempt at Web-Development I knew the gist of creating a basic website. It wasn't too hard to lay out what I wanted in HTML, and rough out the general styling in CSS. However,
there were areas that gave me some trouble; most of my frustrations were focused on properly centering elements, and making sure that text and images scaled properly.

Once I began to flesh out my Illustrator design I soon realized that many crucial elements were missing in my webpage. Navigation would be hard without a navbar. Registering clicks would be difficult without a
hover, and focus state; and so on and so fort. I always knew design was an important part of Web-Development, but I completely forgot that without proper UI/UX considerations users would have a hard time navigating
and subsequently enjoying my creations. I added needed elements, as an after thought, and looking at my main page they look the part.

Looking on the bright side, I learned a lot; and I feel more confident and inspired to make more, and better looking websites!
