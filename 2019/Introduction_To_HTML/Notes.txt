        - Ordered lists can be used for directions where order is important

        - Many things can be stored within a list item,

            + Paragraphs
            + Etc...

    + Block Elements Vs. Inline Elements
        - In the case of headings, nothing comes after a block element, with respect to the same line
        - In contrast, things can come after inline elements, ex hyperlink, line breaks
        - Important when differentiating between div & span

# SIDE NOTES:
    + Don't use inline <b> for bolding, it's deprecated
        - Follows HTML5 and semantic markup
