# Lecture Notes:
    + Appropriate Fonts
        - You need fonts that work with the style of the page to help information flow

    + What fonts work for webpages?
        - Not all fonts work, different on every computer!
            + System Fonts that come on each machine
        - Can Include custom fonts

    + Like CSS Before, Use the Selector & Attribute Method
        Can change:
            + font-family
                - Obvs the font style
            + font-size
                - Size, can use pixels or em
                - em being a relative font size
                - Extremely important in responsive websites
            + font-weight
            + line-weight
            + line-height
            + text-align
            + text-decoration

    + Introduction To The Box Model
        - On CSS every element has a box around it
        - Can style different aspects of the box of an element
            + Content
                - What goes inside
            + Padding
                - The spacing between the content and the border
            + Border
                - Border itself, refer to border style
            + Margin
                - The spacing between the border and everything else


# SIDE NOTES:
    + By default an element goes all the way across the screen

    + Applies only to the content, everything else is built on these values
        - To change the width of the paragraph I can use the width: property
        - To change the height of the element you can use the height: property
            + Aren't limited to pixels, can use percentages (Responsive Design)

    + Padding can be applied to just one side
        - There are different attributes

    + Just like Padding, Margin can be applied to different sides
        - But in this case it applies to the outside of the border
            + Like border, shortcuts can be used when defining complex margins

        - Can Use Margin & Auto To Center Elements
            + margin: top right bottom left
