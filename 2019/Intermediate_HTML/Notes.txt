# Lecture Notes:
    + Table are extremely useful when trying to display information
    + Remember Rows And Columns

    + To create a table element just use <table> </table>
        - State The Rows with <tr> </tr>
        - And within each row put in the columns with <td> </td>

    + To add border to a table you would first use CSS, but can add an attribute to the table

    + To add a table head use <th> in place of <td>

    + You should use <thead> for the heading of the table,
    + And <tbody> for the bosy of the table, won't do anything but helps with screen readers

# SIDE NOTES:
    + Once you get the overall vibe of html you can move onto CSS
