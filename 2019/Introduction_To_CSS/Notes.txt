        + https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

    - CSS Zen Garden

# Lecture Notes:
    + Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) adds flavor to the bulk of your content
    + CSS must be separate from HTML file, thus the same style sheets

    + General Rule Of CSS:
        - SELECT AN ONJECT --> APPLY STYLES INSIDE OF CURLY BRACES

    + Colors in CSS
        - Defining colors by name is inaccurate, we can overcome this by implementing more robust color systems
            + Hexadecimal colors
                - Most useful, uses base 16 range
                - Start with Octathorp
                - Uses additive color scheme

            + RGB colors

            + RGBA colors
                - Can be used when transparency is needed rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)

    + Background & Border
        - As the name suggest you can change the background and border of an object
            + In CSS, add a background attribute and add the color you would like to use
                - ex background: rgba(100, 200, 100, 1)

        - The background can also be an image
            + Pass background: url(LINK) to set an image as the background
            + If the image isn't big enough it will be repeated
                - Can use a tiled friendly image
                - Or pass background-repeat: -- as another attribute within the body tag in CSS
                    + no-repeat;
                    + can also pass background-size: cover; to get a full cover background

        - A border can be added to each object
            + Like other attributes, but can needs three characters
                border-color: ;
                border-width: ;
                border-style: ;

            + To make it easier can pass border: (SIZE) (STYLE) (COLOUR);

    + CSS Selectors
        - Remember, to style a CSS element we use a selector then add and attribute within the curly brackets
            + Not forgetting to add ; at the end

        - If you want to single out just one element you can do so with an ID selector
        - <p id = "NAME">
            + And when stating it in CSS list an octothorp then the name listed (HOOK)

        - To do the same thing but for multiple elements use the class hook
        - <p class = "NAME">
            + In CSS use a . & NAME when connecting to it


    + Inheritance & Specificity
        - If you change the CSS of a parent element, it will influence the child element within it
            + Type selectors are the least specific (Not So Specific)
            + Class, Attributes, Pseudo-Class (Moderately Specific)
            + ID Selector (Fairly Specific)





# SIDE NOTES:
    + CSS must be referenced in HTML file, as the metadata
        + Use a link tag in head
    + CSS can be written as inline code, or even within a style tag, however it is best to be written as a separate sheet
        - Separation of Concerns

    + Base Number Systems
        - Base 10, Min 0 | Max 9  | Ten Digits      | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        - Base 16, Min 0 | Max 15 | Sixteen Digits  | 0 - 1, A - F

    + DONT FORGET THE ; AT THE END OF EVERY LINE IN CSS, YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES BECAUSE OF IT!!!!!!!!!

    + &nbsp = space between characters
    + <br> = new line between characters

    + There are many types of CSS selectors:
        - Element
        - Class
        - ID
        - Star
        - Descendant
        - Adjacent
        - Attribute
        - Nth Of Type
            + Can apply to even, or odd elements
