## 1.0 General Overview of Project ##
I want to build a blog. Nothing fancy, no moving carousels, call to subscriptions, or CSS animations (okay maybe one or two). I just want a blog to achieve my thoughts and personal projects and that's it.

<br />

## 1.1 Design Approach ##
As previously mentioned, the blog that I want to create should be simple - free of anything that may slow the learning process. However it should look like a blog that I created. It should have my style.
I've put together a series of screenshots as well as general themes that I want to emulate in my blog that will help describe the look that I'm after.
