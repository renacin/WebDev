## 1.0 General Overview of Project ##
I want to build a blog. Nothing fancy, no moving carousels, call to subscriptions, or CSS animations (okay maybe one or two). I just want a blog to achieve my thoughts and personal projects and that's it.

<br/>

## 1.1 Design Approach ##
As previously mentioned, the blog that I want to create should be simple - free of anything that may slow the learning process. However it should look like a blog that I created. It should have my style.
I've put together a series of screenshots as well as general themes that I want to emulate in my blog that will help describe the look that I'm after.

I know, two artboards doesn't really explain much - let alone convey the idea that I have going in my head; but I can get the general picture across. I want a straight forward blog that has a simple yet modern layout. Making
conservative use of simple polygons (mostly rectangles), high contrast fonts, as well as colors - most of the website should be dedicated to negative space. I want the reader to quickly understand the flow of the blog, find
what they need and accomplish what they came to do. Simple enough.

In terms of styling I want the blog to look like an IDE, or some sort of programming environment. Unlike programming however, I still want the website to friendly and approachable. Most people are quite afraid of the command
line; I don't want that.

I've roughed out the main page in Illustrator.
