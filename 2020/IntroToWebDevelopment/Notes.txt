    + HTML In Depth
        - As part of Tim Berners-Lee definition of the WEB; Hyper Text was formalized. Heavily based on SGML
            + Internet Based Hypertext System

        - HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements
        - An element is data surrounded by tags; in rare cases (Void Tags) are elements not enclosed at the end
            + Elements can also have attributes and values as well

    + HTML Boilerplate (Skeleton)
        - <!DOCTYPE html>
            + Is a flag for your browser; tells it it's looking at an HTML document

        - <html></html>
            + Is the main root element of your HTML documents
            + Can only support 1 head, and 1 body element

        - <head></head>
            + Head element contains machine readable information; mostly for SEO, Document information, and links to
